The code snippet illustrated above shows the procedure for adding a gradient effect to text within a Word document. Initially, a fresh Word document is created. A **TextStyle** object is then initialized and set to utilize a gradient effect, specifically selecting the `Gradient.DefaultGray` preset for the **GradientEffect** property. This configured **TextStyle** is then applied to the phrase "Hello World," which is inserted into the document. To finalize, the document with the new styling is exported.
