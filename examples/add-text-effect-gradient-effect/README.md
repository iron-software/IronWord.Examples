The provided code snippet illustrates the process of adding a gradient effect to text within a Word document. Initially, a new Word document is created. Subsequently, a `TextStyle` object is initiated and it is set to utilize a gradient effect. This is achieved by assigning the `Gradient.DefaultGray` preset to the `GradientEffect` property of the `TextStyle`. After configuring the `TextStyle`, it is applied to the text "Hello World," which is subsequently included in the document. The document is then saved.
