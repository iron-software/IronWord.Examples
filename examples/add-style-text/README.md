The example demonstrates how to utilize the IronWord library for manipulating a DOCX file. It begins by loading a DOCX file into a `WordDocument` object. Following this, it introduces a `Text` element, applying several styles such as a particular font family and size, color (red), and diverse text effects. Subsequently, it forms a new `Paragraph` object, incorporates the formatted text into this paragraph, and integrates the paragraph into the `WordDocument`. The process concludes by saving the changes in a new document.
