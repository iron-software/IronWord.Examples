This segment demonstrates the application of IronWord, an Iron Software library, to edit a DOCX file. Initially, the existing document is imported into an instance of the `WordDocument` class. Subsequently, it proceeds to insert a Text element, configuring multiple attributes such as font style, font size, color (specifically red), and various text effects. Following this, a new `Paragraph` object is instantiated and the pre-styled text is incorporated into this paragraph. This paragraph is then appended to the main body of the Word document. To finalize, the document is saved as a newly transformed file.
