Text can exist in various sections of a document, like paragraphs or tables. To delete particular text, locate it in the paragraph and employ the `RemoveTextRun` method, where you pass the specific `TextRun` object for removal. Additionally, if you need to eliminate an entire paragraph, simply access that paragraph and execute the `Remove` method.
