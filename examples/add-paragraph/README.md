Paragraphs are fundamental components of a Word document, encompassing a variety of elements including texts, images, and other shapes. The code sample illustrates how to insert a paragraph featuring text with varied styles into a new Word document.

In this scenario, a new Word document is established, into which several pieces of text—each styled distinctly—are incorporated. The texts are appended to the paragraph via the `AddText` method, and subsequently, the paragraph is incorporated into the document using the `AddParagraph` method. The document is then saved as a file.
