Applying a text outline effect using IronWord is straightforward yet highly customizable. Once you've loaded a Word document, you can set up the text style to include a text outline by assigning `TextOutlineEffect.DefaultEffect` to the `**TextOutlineEffect**` property within a new `TextEffect` instance. This configuration allows you to apply the text outline effect to any amount of text. After configuring, simply export the document.
