Applying a text outline to text is incredibly straightforward using IronWord. Despite its ease of use, each attribute of the text outline can be fine-tuned to meet specific requirements. Once a Word document has been loaded, the `textStyle` is set to incorporate a text outline effect by assigning `TextOutlineEffect.DefaultEffect` to the **TextOutlineEffect** property of a new `TextEffect` instance. This customized effect can then be applied to any amount of text. Finally, the document is saved with the new formatting.
