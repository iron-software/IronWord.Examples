Adding a shadow effect to text in a Word document can be easily achieved through a brief snippet of code. To begin, we must first set up a new `WordDocument` instance named `doc`. Following that, we create a `TextStyle` object and configure it to apply a shadow effect. This is done by setting its `TextEffect` property to `Shadow.OuterShadow1`, a pre-defined static instance. We then proceed to insert the text "Hello World" into the document with the newly configured `textStyle`. Finally, the document is exported.
