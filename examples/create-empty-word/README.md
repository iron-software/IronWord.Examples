IronWord simplifies the process of generating new Word and DOCX files. Begin by creating a new instance of the `WordDocument` object. Additionally, structures such as paragraphs, tables, and sections can also be initiated to build a new Word document. To finalize and export your document, employ the `SaveAs` method.
