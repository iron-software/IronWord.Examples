Let's construct a fresh Word document and insert text that features a reflection effect. Firstly, a **WordDocument** object called `doc` is initialized. Following this, a **TextStyle** object is created and prepared with a reflection effect by assigning its **TextEffect** property to a new `Reflection` object. The text "Hello World" is then added to this document, showcasing the reflection effect. To conclude, the document is saved.
