Let's begin by generating a new Word document and incorporating text with a reflection effect. Start by establishing a new `**WordDocument**` instance referred to as `doc`. Next, create and configure a `**TextStyle**` instance. You will need to set its `**TextEffect**` property to a new `Reflection` object to enable the reflection effect. Add the text "Hello World" into the document, making sure the reflection effect is applied correctly. To finalize, save the document.
