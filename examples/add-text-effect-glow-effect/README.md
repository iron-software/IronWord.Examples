This style is enhanced with a glow effect, set up through initializing a `TextEffect` object with precise configurations. The phrase "Hello World" is incorporated into the document, and the recently configured `textStyle` with the glow effect is applied to this text. In conclusion, the Word document is saved as a new file.
