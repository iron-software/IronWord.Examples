The preceding code segment demonstrates how to open a Word document and set up an image with specified dimensions. It then goes on to create a new `Paragraph` instance, embedding the configured image through the `AddImage` method associated with the paragraph. This fully configured paragraph is then integrated into the document with the `AddParagraph` call. The document, now updated, is then saved or exported.
